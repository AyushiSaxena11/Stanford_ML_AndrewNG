## What I learned:

* During Week 1: 
   Machine Learning Definition and its real-time applications, Supervised Learning( Regression, Classification and examples), Unsupervised               Learning(Clustering as example), Linear Regression with one variable, Model Representation. Cost function (well-explained with intuititons),  Contour plots, Parameter learning-(Gradient Descent, Gradient Descent for Linear Regression and its Intuition. Important topics of Linear Algebra.
   
* During Week 2:
   Multivariate Linear Regression(Multiple features), Gradient Descent Algorithm for Multiple Variables, Feature Scaling, Learning Rate, Feature and polynomial regression, Normal equation, Normal Equation Noninvertibility. Octave Installation. Octave/Matlab tutorial: Basic Operations, Moving Data Around, Computing on Data, Plotting Data, Control Statements: for, while, if statement, Vectorization. But, I haven't practiced Octave Programming much. I have completed all my assignments in Python3.



Week 3:Logistic Regression--Classification,Hypothesis Representatio, Decision Boundary,Cost function and gradient descent,Advanced Optimization, Multiclass Classification: One-vs-all, Regularisation,Problem of Overfitting, Regularised Linear Regression, Regularised Logistic Regression, Programming Assignment

Week 4: Neural   Networks: Non-linear Hypothesis,Neurons and the brain, Model Representation, Applications, Multiclass Classification

Week 5
